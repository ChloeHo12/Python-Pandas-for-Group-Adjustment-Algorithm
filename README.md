# Group-Adjustment-Algorithm

In this assignment, I am able to deal with group_adjust where there are two groups (Country and States). 
If I have more time, I would work on two main areas:
- Calculate country means in case countries are not the same. In this assignment, I'm assuming that there is only one country - United States
- Deal with more than two groups. In the event that there is cities group, I was able to find the mean of cities group but not able to find the mean of states. I also had trouble merging states and cities into a pivot table.
