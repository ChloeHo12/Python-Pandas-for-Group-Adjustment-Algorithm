# Group-Adjustment-Algorithm

Your task is to write the group adjustment method below. The algorithm needs to do the following:

1.) For each group-list provided, calculate the means of the values for each unique group.

   For example:
   
     vals       = [  1  ,   2  ,   3  ]
     ctry_grp   = ['USA', 'USA', 'USA']
     state_grp  = ['MA' , 'MA' ,  'CT' ]

   There is only 1 country in the ctry_grp list.  So to get the means:
   
     USA_mean == mean(vals) == 2
     ctry_means = [2, 2, 2]
     
   There are 2 states, so to get the means for each state:
   
     MA_mean == mean(vals[0], vals[1]) == 1.5
     CT_mean == mean(vals[2]) == 3
     state_means = [1.5, 1.5, 3]

2.) Using the weights, calculate a weighted average of those group means
   Continuing from our example:
   
    weights = [.35, .65]
    ctry_means  = [2  , 2  , 2]
    state_means = [1.5, 1.5, 3]
    weighted_means = [2*.35 + .65*1.5, 2*.35 + .65*1.5, 2*.35 + .65*3]

3.) Subtract the weighted average group means from each original value
   Continuing from our example:
   
     val[0] = 1
     ctry[0] = 'USA' --> 'USA' mean == 2, ctry weight = .35
     state[0] = 'MA' --> 'MA'  mean == 1.5, state weight = .65
     weighted_mean = 2*.35 + .65*1.5 = 1.675
     demeaned = 1 - 1.675 = -0.675
   
   Do this for all values in the original list.

4.) Return the demeaned values
